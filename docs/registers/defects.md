# Defect register

Defects in the existing implementation, found during analysis. Each needs a
`disposition`: PRESERVE (Bund2 reproduces the bug) or FIX (Bund2 corrects it,
and the affected golden is regenerated with a reference to this entry).

Fixing a behavioural defect is a deviation from 100% preservation and needs an
explicit decision. Leaving `disposition` empty blocks any work item that would
touch the area.

---

## F1 — `unregister` registered twice
The class variant shadows the lambda variant, so lambda unregistration is
unreachable by name. The class one is presumably meant to be `unregister.class`.
- `reference/rust_multistackvm/src/stdlib/lambdas/registry.rs`
- Behavioural. Disposition:

## F2 — `if.false.in_workbench` uses the wrong stack
`stdlib_logic_if_false_in_workbench` passes `StackOps::FromStack`, not
`FromWorkBench`.
- `reference/rust_multistackvm/src/stdlib/logic/if_fun.rs`
- Behavioural. Disposition:

## F3 — `stdlib_math_op_inline` checks the wrong stack
The `FromWorkBench` arm checks `current_stack_len()` before separately checking
`workbench.len()`.
- `reference/rust_multistackvm/src/stdlib/math/math_op.rs`
- Behavioural. Disposition:

## F4 — redundant clone in `push_to_workbench`
Clones an owned value, pushes the clone, drops the original.
- `reference/rust_multistack/src/ts_workbench.rs`
- Performance only. Disposition: FIX

## F5 — `_inline` suffix rebuilt three times per call
`is_inline` formats it once; `get_inline` formats it again for `contains_key`
and a third time for `get`.
- `reference/rust_multistackvm/src/multistackvm_inline.rs`
- Performance only. Disposition: FIX

## F6 — alias resolved twice per CALL
Once in `apply`, again in `i()`.
- `reference/rust_multistackvm/src/multistackvm_apply.rs`, `multistackvm_inline.rs`
- Performance only. Disposition: FIX

## F7 — instrumentation in the dispatch path
`time_graph::instrument` on `apply`, `i`, `i_direct`, `call`, `lambda_eval`,
`stdlib_execute_base_inline`, `stdlib_logic_if_base`, `stdlib_logic_times`.
Must be removed or feature-gated before any baseline measurement.
- Performance only. Disposition: FIX

## F8 — unbounded inter-crate version pins
`">=0.*.*"` between the five library crates: a `Value` layout change propagates
silently.
- Resolved by the monorepo. Disposition: FIX (structural)

## F9 — the parser has a side channel
The `ctx` rule mutates the caller's `state` vector rather than returning a
subtree, which makes `( ... )` unanalysable.
- `reference/bund_language_parser/src/vm/ctx.rs`
- Structural. Disposition: FIX (scoped block node, RFC-0003)

## F10 — debugger history written to the working directory
- `reference/Bund/src/stdlib/functions/debug_fun/`
- Cosmetic. Disposition: FIX

## F11 — inverted guard in `register_method_value_init`
`if ! value.type_of() == OBJECT` parses as `(!value.type_of()) == OBJECT`; the
guard never fires as intended.
- `reference/Bund/src/stdlib/functions/oop/value_class.rs`
- Behavioural. Disposition:
